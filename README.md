# The Odin Project -  Etch-a-sketch project
This project was made while doing The Odin Project. </br>
I did a box full of squares that you can color with three colors (black, white, blue) and you have three square sizes to choose from (16x16, 32x32 or 64x64).</br><br>

## Technologies used
**HTML** </br>
**CSS** (styling, flexbox, hover-effects, classes that toggle on-off)</br>
**JavaScript** (event-listeners, DOM-manipulation, grid-creation, manipulating CSS-styles on coloring the boxes)</br></br>

## What I learned
I used my skills on **flexboxes** when structuring the site. I used **JavaScript** to **manipulate the DOM-elements based on what color the user chooses and what box-size**.</br>
In this project I **used my JavaScript-skills**, **and** got to use **flexboxes** again when structuring the website.
